But there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer on how to fit usability testing into your optimization process. It really depends on the case, what insight you looking for and what you want to achieve.\n\nI'll often do a 5 sec test in connection with a new LP to get an idea of how users intuitively react to a given page or message (very, very simple testing). On the other end of the spectrum is real usability testing with live test subjects thinking aloud while solving tasks. In between these two extremes are e.g. some of the other tools that UsabilityHub offers e.g. preference test or click through test.  \n\nUsability testing is just one tool in your Conversion Research arsenal.

Ã‚Â Our goal was to continue using Unbounce for our landing pages and embed a Hubspot form to take advantage of the Hubspot capabilities -- We thought this was going to be a match made in heaven!!!  \n  \nBUT....Hubspot only pulls in formÃ‚Â information to their campaign dashbaordsÃ‚Â if you use their HubspotÃ‚Â Landing Pages!! Ã‚Â We created a work around where we're pulling Unbounce code to populate the Hubspot landing page, though this method leaves a lot of room for error and is a bit of a pain. We've nicked named it \"Inception\" due to the multiple layers of it.  \n  \nWe would love to hear some more stories about how Unbounce and others teams are using Unbounce and Hubspot so we can find out the best solution to integrate both of them!!  \n  \nPS - We have been working with our Hubspot rep to allow the info from their standalone forms to register in their campaign dashboardsÃ‚Â and we would love if the Unbounce community could help upvote this ticket to make it happen!!! If we could embed a Hubspot form into our Unbounce landing pages which would track in our Hubspot campaigns, this would be the perfect mix!  \n  \nHere's the Hubspot ticket to upvote it:Ã‚Â [  \"Link    \n  \nHope everyone is having a great day!!  \n  \nPS - Unbounce - we had a great time at the NYC Unbounce event last year and hope you guys do this again...  \n  \nCheers"],"prob":["using, create, possible, multiple, wondering, wufoo, infusionsoft"],"frex":["using, possible, wondering, create, wufoo, infusionsoft, multiple"],"lift":["wondering, possible, using, infusionsoft, wufoo, password, multiple"],"score":["using, create, possible, multiple, wufoo, infusionsoft, wondering"],"proportion":["0.02"]}],"topic_no":[13,29]},{"name":["redirect, site, used, wordpress, unbounce, domains, website"],"children":[{"name":["site, website, wordpress, unbounce, homepage, plugin, web"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[14],"thought_1":["We are an educational institution looking into redesigning our current web site which currently contains easily over 100 pages.
